# UI Challenge 2

## Purpose
This is a website made to practice skills in UI matching. It features a title and 5 sections of form inputs. For the Radio and checkbox it makes use of sprite animation to achieve the custom icons on check and uncheck.

## Project Constraints
For this project we were only allowed to use HTML and CSS. One of the requirements was to have a input:invalid message display below the text box. However from my research it is not possible to achieve a custoized message in this box without using javascript. I thus left it
